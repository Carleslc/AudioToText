1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I get up in the evening

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I ain't got nothing to say

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I come home in the morning

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I go to bed feeling the same way

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I ain't nothing but tired

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey there, baby

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I could use just a little help

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can't start a fire

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can't start a fire without a spark

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There's guns for hire

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
