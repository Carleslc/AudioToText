00:00.001 --> 00:03.000
I get up in the evening

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
And I ain't got nothing to say

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
I come home in the morning

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I go to bed feeling the same way

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
I ain't nothing but tired

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Hey there, baby

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I could use just a little help

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
You can't start a fire

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
You can't start a fire without a spark

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
There's guns for hire

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
