I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
There's guns for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
