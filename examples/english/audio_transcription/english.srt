00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The little tales they tell are false.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The door was barred, locked, and bolted as well.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ripe pears are fit for a queen's table.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000

The pleasant hours fly by much too soon.

The beetle droned in the hot June sun.
