1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
The little tales they tell are false.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,520
The door was barred, locked

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,240
and bolted as well. Ripe pears are fit for a Queen's table.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,400
A big wet stain was on the round carpet.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,960
The kite dipped and swayed

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,480
but stayed aloft. The pleasant hours fly by much too soon.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
The room was crowded with a mild wob.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,200
The room was crowded with a wild mob.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,400
This strong arm shall shield your honour.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,040
She blushed when he gave her a white orchid.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,040
The beetle droned in the hot June sun.
