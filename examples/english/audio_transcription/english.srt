1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The little tales, they tell, are false.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The door was barred, locked, and bolted as well.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ripe pairs are fit for a queen's table.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A big wet stain was on the round carpet.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The kite dipped and swayed, but stayed aloft.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The pleasant hours fly by much too soon.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The room was crowded with a mild wob.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The room was crowded with a wild mob.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This strong arm shall shield your honour.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She blushed when he gave her a white orchid.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The beetle droned in the hot June sun.
