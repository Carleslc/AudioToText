One of the most famous landmarks on the Borders, it's three hills, and the myth is that Merlin, the magician, split one hill into three, and he left the two hills at the back of us, which you can see.

The weather's never good though, I always say on the Borders, if the mist's on the Yieldens, we never get the good weather. And as you can see today, there's no sunshine. It's a typical Scottish Borders day.
