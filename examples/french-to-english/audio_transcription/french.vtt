Whisper is an automatic recognition system of speech,

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
trained on 680,000 hours of multi-language and multi-tasking data collected on the Internet.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
We establish that the use of data of such number and such diversity

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
is the reason why our system is able to understand many accents,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
despite background noise, to understand technical vocabulary

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
and to succeed in translating from several languages ​​into English.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
We distribute, as a free software, the source code for our models and for inference,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
so that it can serve as a starting point to build useful applications

00:38.000 --> 01:02.000
and to help to make research progress in speech processing.
