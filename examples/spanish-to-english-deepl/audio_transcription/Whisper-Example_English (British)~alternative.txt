2022 will be remembered as the year of Stable Diffusion, of Dali 2, of incredible models
text generators such as Palm or code generators such as AlphaCode.
And yet, chatting last month with Andr√©s Torrubia, he told me that the
most interesting thing I'd seen this year was an artificial intelligence that was coming
from the OpenAI lab, an AI called Whisper.
What do you think is the most impressive thing that has come out this year?
Well, oddly enough, look, oddly enough, so far Whisper, I think.
Do you know why?
Curious, eh.
What impresses me about Whisper is that Whisper works, it's like, for me, Whisper, if it were
the autonomous car, it would be the first self-driving car in the dictation, i.e. it is the first one that resembles
to a person.
Well, but in order for you to first understand what this Whisper thing is, I'm going to ask you to
do the following exercise.
I am going to play you an audio in English and your task is to transcribe each of the words
you are listening to.
Are you ready?
Three, two, one.
Have you understood anything?
Yeah, me neither.
Well, in the ears of this artificial intelligence, this is the perfect transcription it has achieved.
How is your Korean?
Well, it's no problem for Whisper either, and he can also transcribe this audio at
perfect English.
And well, he understands me too.
What you're seeing on the screen now is the speech to text that Whisper gets when it
I pass on the audio track you are listening to.
Look closely, not only does he get a near-perfect transcription, understanding even words
such as Whisper or speech to text, but it is also capable of generating full stops, commas
and other punctuation marks than many other commercial recognition models
of speech as he tends to choke on it.
And this is very interesting.
Well, not this, but Whisper.
Whisper in general has many interesting things and the first interesting thing is the context
in which this tool appears.
After a year of amazing achievements by the Artificial Intelligence Lab
OpenAI, suddenly out of the blue a collaborative initiative like Stability.ai
which in September takes up the banner of making open source many of the technologies that
OpenAI for its part has decided to keep to itself and share only under services
payment.
This is not a problem for me either, because in the end OpenAI as a company has
to pay their bills and at least it's giving us a way to access these powerful
artificial intelligences.
Learn Google.
But of course, a new little boy arrives in town and starts giving out sweets to the
children and all of a sudden the popular kid starts to be displaced.
And at that precise moment OpenAI comes out of nowhere and gives us Whisper for our benefit
of all.
Because yes, my friends, this is open source, and I know you love to hear these words.
At the end of the video I'm going to show you a mini tutorial so you can see how easy it is to use
this tool and I'm also going to share a notebook to make it super easy for you to
you.
And this is what makes Whisper a super interesting tool, but it is not the only thing.
And this is where one of the things that has caught my attention is that Whisper
is not a complex system that has been designed to process audio in a way that has never been done before
made or a super-complex system with a lot of processing modules.
No, Whisper is this right here, a transformer neural network from 2017, it doesn't have
no change, nothing new.
It is an architecture with which we are all familiar.
So, if this is the case, why didn't a technology like Whisper already exist?
Well, the key to what makes Whisper so powerful is in the data and how it has been used
structured their training.
To train him, OpenAI used no less than 680,000 hours of audio with its
corresponding text, a brutality.
And if you calculate 680,000 hours and start reproducing them now, you would end up with
to listen to it 77 years from now.
You could be sure that at some point in the sky you would see Halley's comet streaking across the sky.
But what's more, a very interesting thing is that these audios come in multiple languages,
allowing us to be able to train a model that is multilingual, that can understand us
whether we speak to him in Spanish, English, Korean, it doesn't matter.
But it doesn't stop there.
Whisper is not only a multilingual system, but also a multitasking system.
This is a trend that, as we saw in the video on Gato, in the world of deep
learning is becoming more and more frequent.
Do not train artificial intelligence for a single task, but train it for several tasks
different, thus making their learning much more solid and robust.
As we have seen, Whisper can take audios in English and transcribe them into English, or
audio in Korean and transcribe it into Korean.
But the same model can also identify which language is being spoken, or acted upon
as a speech detector to classify when a piece of audio is not being listened to
to a person.
Or also, the task that I find most interesting of all, that you can talk to him or her
to Whisper in any language and have it automatically transcribe it into English for you.
And in this case I can't tell you why, but for me this seems to me to be one of the most important functions
fascinating.
It doesn't seem to offer us anything new either, does it?
In the end you can take the text generated by any text transcriber in your language
and run it through a translator.
But in this case, I find it fascinating to see how something as simple as a single
deep learning model allows you to speak to it in any language and have it generate the text for you
in English without having to combine any tools.
It's super simple.
And the data we discussed earlier is also very interesting.
Because my first intuition here is that OpenAI, in the search for a massive dataset
of these 680,000 hours of audio to have a text transcription in order to be able to make
this supervised apprenticeship, as he had possibly gone to one of the largest sources of
that we can find on the Internet, which is YouTube.
In the end you know that all YouTube videos are automatically generated with subtitles.
Well, no.
This is precisely what OpenAI puts a lot of emphasis on in its paper to explain what they have done
a filtering process to remove from the dataset any text occurrences generated by
automatic speech recognition systems.
Why?
It was precisely to prevent Whisper from learning those defects, those vices, too
that other automatic systems may also have.
That said, now that we're talking about Whisper and YouTube, there is a theory that
I want to tell you that I think it's very interesting, it's nothing that is confirmed, but that
could explain the reason for the existence of this tool and that it could have a certain relationship with the
with a future GPT-4.
This is an idea I heard on Dr. Alan Thompson's channel, which says that in
the near future, where GPT-4 can begin training, Whisper could offer the system
a huge source of data that previous systems had not been able to count on.
Think of a system like GPT-3 as having been trained with a lot of Wikipedia articles,
of books, of forums, of Internet conversations, but he has never been able to access all of the
that spoken source that may be in databases such as YouTube.
A tool such as Whisper could be used to sweep YouTube completely, transcribe
many of their audios and get, unlock a new source of data that previously would not have
It has been possible to use it to train a future language model.
This is the enormous value of a tool like Whisper that I think makes it so interesting
to this technology.
No, it does not solve a task that is spectacular, such as generating images or generating video, but it does
solves a very useful task and almost solves it to perfection.
I say almost, it's not perfect, sometimes some words are obviously wrong and it doesn't cover it
all the languages that exist on planet Earth, and well, to look for some limitation
compared to other commercial tools, as it does not yet work in real time either.
Depending on the length of the audio it can take a few seconds to process it, sometimes
It's a solid tool, it's mature, it's useful and it's open source,
now allowing anyone to have access to a professional transcription tool
and text translation better than any free alternative.
What?
Oh, that you too would like to have access to this tool.
Well, come on, I'll prepare an easy tutorial for all of you to use.
We are going to do it in Google Colab, but first and taking advantage of the fact that we are talking about programming,
of development, of innovation, let me remind you that there are very few days left
for Samsung Dev Day, which is the technology event held every year to celebrate the Samsung
year the Samsung Dev Spain community, which is Samsung's official community for developers
Spanish.
This will be a free event not to be missed.
If you are in Madrid you can attend in person on 16th November at the cloister of
the Hieronymites of the Museo del Prado and if not, you can connect online at
its streaming.
But yes, you have to register, I was lucky enough to be able to participate last year with one of my own
presentation on code generation with artificial intelligence and the experience was
great.
So you see, it's going to be an event full of great talks, talking about technology,
of innovation, of applications, and it will also be presented by my dudev, who will surely
Many of you will know him, so you can't miss him.
I'll leave a link to the Samsung Dev website below in the description box
Spain, where you will find all the information regarding the agenda where you can register and a
a lot of other resources.
See you on 16 November.
Let's see how we can use Whisper in our own code.
For this we are going to use Google Colab, you know that Google is giving us here
a free virtual machine that we can use and we will check as long as we have
enabled the GPU hardware accelerated environment type, OK, let's hit it here
GPU, let's hit save and now the first step will be to install Whisper.
To do this we are going to use these two commands here, to install, you can find this here
in Whisper's own GitHub repository, I'm going to leave you below in the description box
these commands, hit run and let it install.
Once installed, we are going to upload some audio that we want to transcribe, in this case
I'm going to try Rosal√≠a's song from Chicken Teriyaki, let's put it here,
we drag it and now the next step we are going to take it here and we are going to put the command
necessary to be able to run it, we're going to hit song.mp3 here, it's called the file that we
we have uploaded, okay, song.mp3, so the task is going to be to transcribe the size of the model,
there are different sizes depending on whether you want more speed when making the inference
or if you want more precision in the results, I usually work with the Medium model
which is the one that gives me good results, there are bigger models, there are smaller models, try it
and in this case simply where we are going to place the output file, we run
and that's it, that's it, no more to do, okay, we're already using Whisper,
the first time it will take a little while because you have to download the model but from this
At the moment you can use this system to transcribe any audio you want,
mola, ok, we can see that in this case it has detected that the language is Spanish, it has made the inference
automatic because we haven't told you that we are going to transcribe from Spanish, you can do it
if you want and when this cell is already executed, we can come here, we see
that the Audio Transcription folder has been generated and here we have the different options, we can
open the sound.txt and here we open the file, we can see that we have the whole song perfectly
transcribed, which in this case, being Rosal√≠a, has more merit and instead of wanting to
transcription, you would like to make the translation, i.e. to convert your
voice, your audio to English, so all you have to do is change here the
task by Translate and in this case Whisper will work to translate what it has transcribed.
In this case, if you notice, the command we have used is the console command
but you may want to use Whisper within your code, then you can also
you have the option to work with Whisper's own library, it's simply this one
line of code from here, import it, load the model we want, here then
I would load the Medium model which is the one that, as I said, works best for my case, and with
the loaded model then here we call model.transcribe, let's put here song.mp3, we hit run
and in a matter of seconds we will have our transcript back.
And here it is, the Rosalia, pink without a card, I send it to your cat, I have it for you
with roulette, no need for a serenade, ok.
However, to make your life easier, I have prepared a notebook that you can use,
is below in the description box, where you already have all the code ready for
to start working, just log in, check that the GPU is activated,
click on this button here to install everything necessary, here we choose the
task we want to do, whether it is transcribing into any language or translating into English
and click on run.
In this case the cell is prepared so that the moment you start to run it
your microphone is recording right now, i.e. right now we would be generating
an audio file that we will then use for transcribing with Whisper, this is by
if you want to make a real-time transcript of any class or anything else
you need.
We're going to hit stop, we hit this button and in a moment we have the result of what we've done
we have said.
Below you will find the two commands needed to be able to transcribe or translate
the audio you upload.
Finally, you should also know that if you want something simpler, then there are pages
website where you can try out this system by uploading your own audios or by recording
from the microphone.
And this would be, 2022 is shaping up to be a spectacular year in terms of numbers
of neural toys that are coming into our hands to build a whole bunch
and to be able to touch them.
Now it's your turn, what can you do about it?
Well, you can build a lot of super interesting things, you can connect by
example Whisper with Stable Diffusion so that you can loudly ask it to
generate a table or you can for example take all your classes at the university or
all working meetings, transcribing them, creating a huge bank of transcripts and
then with the GPT-3 API to make a chatbot that allows you to query, ask questions
and answers on all these sources of information.
For example, something I want to do is to take all the videos from my YouTube channel
and transcribe it, generate good quality subtitles in both Spanish and English
and to be able to make statistics and queries on how many times I have said for example the word
Machine Learning.
There are a lot of applications that you can start to build, that you can start to build, that you can start to
create by combining all these technologies.
I had a dog barking in the background that was bothering me a lot.
Well, as I was saying, you can create a lot of things and there is a lot to do.
From here, from this channel, we will continue to experiment with this technology,
I will continue to bring you new tools so if you haven't done so yet, please subscribe,
